## Overview

Too many events happening around your city leads to information overload, choice paradox, lack of personalization, generic recommendations, disorganized information, budget and time constraints, and the need for additional planning and scheduling.

Eventopia is a smart event-planning app that provides a personalized solution for discovering and planning events.  It personalizes event recommendations, optimizes itineraries based on budget and time, and leverages user preferences (including optional browsing history analysis) to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience.
